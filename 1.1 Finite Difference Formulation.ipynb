This is not the only way to do it, however I do find my method to be rather convenient. In my day to day work, I do seperate the models from the \"solvers\" and from other scripts that do supervisory type calculations above it, such as model calibration and model-based predictive controls. You'll see that in Chapters 2 & 3.\n",
